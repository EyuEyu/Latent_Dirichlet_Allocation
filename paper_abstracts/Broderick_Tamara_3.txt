Title:
Covariances, Robustness, and Variational Bayes
Abstract: Variational Bayes (VB) is an approximate Bayesian posterior inference
technique that is increasingly popular due to its fast runtimes on large-scale
datasets. However, even when VB provides accurate posterior means for certain
parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances. Furthermore,
prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for VB. By deriving a
simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on VB
posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local
robustness measures for VB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of
VB posterior approximations. The estimates for VB posterior covariances rely on
a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature relating derivatives
of posterior expectations to posterior covariances. Our key assumption is that
the VB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior
means -- an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methods are simple, general, and
fast, providing accurate posterior uncertainty estimates and robustness
measures with runtimes that can be an order of magnitude smaller than MCMC.
