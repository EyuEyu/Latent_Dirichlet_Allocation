Title:
Limits on light WIMPs with a 1 kg-scale germanium detector at 160 eVee  physics threshold at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory
Abstract: We report results of a search for light weakly interacting massive particles
(WIMPs) dark matter from CDEX-1 experiment at the China Jinping Underground
Laboratory (CJPL). Constraints on WIMP-nucleon spin-independent (SI) and
spin-dependent (SD) couplings are derived with a physics threshold of 160 eVee,
from an exposure of 737.1 kg-days. The SI and SD limits extend the lower reach
of light WIMPs to 2 GeV and improve over our earlier bounds at WIMPs mass less
than 6 GeV.
