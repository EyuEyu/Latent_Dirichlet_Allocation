Title:
Magnetic properties of a metal-organic antiferromagnet on a distorted  honeycomb lattice
Abstract: For temperatures T well above the ordering temperature T*=3.0+-0.2K the
magnetic properties of the metal-organic material Mn[C10H6(OH)(COO)]2x2H20
built from Mn^2+ ions and 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic anions can be described by a
S=5/2 quantum antiferromagnet on a distorted honeycomb lattice with two
different nearest neighbor exchange couplings J2 \approx 2J1 \approx 1.8K.
Measurements of the magnetization M(H,T) as a function of a uniform external
field H and of the uniform zero field susceptibility \chi(T) are explained
within the framework of a modified spin-wave approach which takes into account
the absence of a spontaneous staggered magnetization at finite temperatures.
