Title:
Near-unity collection efficiency from quantum emitters in bulk diamond  using chirped circular dielectric gratings
Abstract: Efficient collection of fluorescence from nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in
diamond underlies the spin-dependent optical read-out that is necessary for
quantum information processing and enhanced sensing applications. The optical
collection efficiency from NVs within diamond substrates is limited primarily
due to the high refractive index of diamond and the non-directional dipole
emission. Here we introduce a light collection strategy based on chirped,
circular dielectric gratings that can be fabricated on a bulk diamond substrate
to redirect an emitter's far-field radiation pattern. Using a genetic
optimization algorithm, these grating designs achieve 98.9% collection
efficiency for the NV zero-phonon emission line, collected from the back
surface of the diamond with an objective of aperture 0.9. Across the broadband
emission spectrum of the NV (600-800 nm), the chirped grating achieves 82.2%
collection efficiency into a numerical aperture of 1.42, corresponding to an
oil immersion objective again on the back side of the diamond. Our proposed
bulk-dielectric grating structures are applicable to other optically active
solid state quantum emitters in high index host materials.
