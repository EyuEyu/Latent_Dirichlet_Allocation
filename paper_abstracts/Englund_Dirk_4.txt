Title:
Photophysics of GaN single photon sources in the visible spectral range
Abstract: In this work, we present a detailed photophysical analysis of
recently-discovered optically stable, single photon emitters (SPEs) in Gallium
Nitride (GaN). Temperature-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that
the emission lines at 4 K are three orders of magnitude broader than the
transform-limited widths expected from excited state lifetime measurements. The
broadening is ascribed to ultra-fast spectral diffusion. Continuing the
photophysics study on several emitters at room temperature (RT), a maximum
average brightness of ~427 kCounts/s is measured. Furthermore, by determining
the decay rates of emitters undergoing three-level optical transitions,
radiative and non-radiative lifetimes are calculated at RT. Finally,
polarization measurements from 14 emitters are used to determine visibility as
well as dipole orientation of defect systems within the GaN crystal. Our
results underpin some of the fundamental properties of SPE in GaN both at
cryogenic and RT, and define the benchmark for future work in GaN-based
single-photon technologies.
