Title:
Hybrid integration of solid-state quantum emitters on a silicon photonic  chip
Abstract: Scalable quantum photonic systems require efficient single photon sources
coupled to integrated photonic devices. Solid-state quantum emitters can
generate single photons with high efficiency, while silicon photonic circuits
can manipulate them in an integrated device structure. Combining these two
material platforms could, therefore, significantly increase the complexity of
integrated quantum photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate hybrid integration of
solid-state quantum emitters to a silicon photonic device. We develop a
pick-and-place technique that can position epitaxially grown InAs/InP quantum
dots emitting at telecom wavelengths on a silicon photonic chip
deterministically with nanoscale precision. We employ an adiabatic tapering
approach to transfer the emission from the quantum dots to the waveguide with
high efficiency. We also incorporate an on-chip silicon-photonic beamsplitter
to perform a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss measurement. Our approach could enable
integration of pre-characterized III-V quantum photonic devices into
large-scale photonic structures to enable complex devices composed of many
emitters and photons.
