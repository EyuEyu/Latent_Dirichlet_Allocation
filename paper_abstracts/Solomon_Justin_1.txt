Title:
Steklov Geometry Processing: An Extrinsic Approach to Spectral Shape  Analysis
Abstract: We propose Steklov geometry processing, an extrinsic approach to spectral
geometry processing and shape analysis. Intrinsic approaches, usually based on
the Laplace-Beltrami operator, cannot capture the spatial embedding of a shape
up to rigid motion, while many previous extrinsic methods lack theoretical
justification. Instead, we propose a systematic approach by considering the
Steklov eigenvalue problem, computing the spectrum of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
operator of a surface bounding a volume. A remarkable property of this operator
is that it encodes the volumetric geometry. We use the boundary element method
(BEM) to discretize the operator, accelerated by hierarchical numerical schemes
and preconditioning; this pipeline allows us to solve eigenvalue and linear
problems on large-scale meshes despite the density of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
discretization. We further demonstrate that our operators naturally fit into
existing frameworks for geometry processing, making a shift from intrinsic to
extrinsic geometry as simple as substituting the Laplace-Beltrami operator with
the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator.
