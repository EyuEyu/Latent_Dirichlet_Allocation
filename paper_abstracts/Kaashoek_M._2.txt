Title:
Skew-selfadjoint Dirac systems with rational rectangular Weyl functions:  explicit solutions of direct and inverse problems and integrable wave  equations
Abstract: In this paper we study direct and inverse problems for discrete and
continuous time skew-selfadjoint Dirac systems with rectangular (possibly
non-square) pseudo-exponential potentials. For such a system the Weyl function
is a strictly proper rational rectangular matrix function and any strictly
proper rational matrix function appears in this way. In fact, extending earlier
results, given a strictly proper rational matrix function we present an
explicit procedure to recover the corresponding potential using techniques from
mathematical system and control theory. We also introduce and study a nonlinear
generalized discrete Heisenberg magnet model, extending earlier results for the
isotropic case. A large part of the paper is devoted to the related discrete
time systems of which the pseudo-exponential potential depends on an additional
continuous time parameter. Our techniques allows us to obtain explicit
solutions for the generalized discrete Heisenberg magnet model and evolution of
the Weyl functions.
