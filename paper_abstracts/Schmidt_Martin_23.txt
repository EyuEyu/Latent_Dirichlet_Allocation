Title:
Classical and ab initio preparation of reliable structures for polymeric  coordination compounds
Abstract: The detailed investigation of electronic and magnetic properties of polymeric
coordination materials with accurate ab initio quantum mechanical methods is
often computationally extremely demanding because of the large number of atoms
in the unit cell. Moreover, usually the available structural data are
insufficient or poorly determined, especially when the structure contains
hydrogen atoms. In order to be able to perform controlled ab initio
calculations on reliable structures, we use a two-step approach to
systematically prepare model structures for polymeric coordination compound
systems and to relax them to their equilibrium configuration. First, a
structure is constructed on the basis of a crystallographic database and
optimized by force field methods; in the second step, the structure is relaxed
by ab initio quantum mechanical molecular dynamics. With this structure, we
perform accurate electronic structure calculations. We will apply this
procedure to a Fe(II) triazole compound and to a coordination polymer of Cu(II)
ions with 2,5-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)-1,4-dihydroxybenzene.
