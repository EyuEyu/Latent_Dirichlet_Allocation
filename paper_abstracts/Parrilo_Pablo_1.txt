Title:
On the local stability of semidefinite relaxations
Abstract: In this paper we consider a parametric family of polynomial optimization
problems over algebraic sets. Although these problems are typically nonconvex,
tractable convex relaxations via semidefinite programming (SDP) have been
proposed. Often times in applications there is a natural value of the
parameters for which the relaxation will solve the problem exactly. We study
conditions (and quantitative bounds) under which the relaxation will continue
to be exact as the parameter moves in a neighborhood of the original one. It
suffices to restrict to quadratically constrained quadratic programs. Our
framework captures several estimation problems such as low rank approximation,
camera triangulation, rotation synchronization, approximate matrix completion
and approximate GCD. In these applications, a solution is easy under noiseless
observations, and our results guarantee that the SDP relaxation will continue
to solve the problem in the low noise regime.
