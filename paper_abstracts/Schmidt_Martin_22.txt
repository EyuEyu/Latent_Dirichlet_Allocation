Title:
Cu-based metalorganic systems: an ab initio study of the electronic  structure
Abstract: Within a first principles framework, we study the electronic structure of the
recently synthesized polymeric coordination compound
Cu(II)-2,5-bis(pyrazol-1-yl)-1,4-dihydroxybenzene (CuCCP), which has been
suggested to be a good realization of a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain with
antiferromagnetic coupling. By using a combination of classical with ab initio
quantum mechanical methods, we design on the computer reliable modified
structures of CuCCP aimed at studying effects of Cu-Cu coupling strength
variations on this spin-1/2 system. For this purpose, we performed two types of
modifications on CuCCP. In one case, we replaced H in the linker by i) an
electron donating group (NH2) and ii) an electron withdrawing group (CN), while
the other modification consisted in adding H2O and NH3 molecules in the
structure which change the local coordination of the Cu(II) ions. With the
NMTO-downfolding method we provide a quantitative analysis of the modified
electronic structure and the nature of the Cu-Cu interaction paths in these new
structures and discuss its implications for the underlying microscopic model.
