Title:
Ultrafast Graphene Light Emitter
Abstract: Ultrafast electrically driven nanoscale light sources are critical components
in nanophotonics. Compound semiconductor-based light sources for the
nanophotonic platforms have been extensively investigated over the past
decades. However, monolithic ultrafast light sources with a small footprint
remain a challenge. Here, we demonstrate electrically driven ultrafast graphene
light emitters that achieve light pulse generation with up to 10 GHz bandwidth,
across a broad spectral range from the visible to the near-infrared. The fast
response results from ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in graphene, and weak
electron-acoustic phonon-mediated coupling between the electronic and lattice
degrees of freedom. We also find that encapsulating graphene with hexagonal
boron nitride (hBN) layers strongly modifies the emission spectrum by changing
the local optical density of states, thus providing up to 460 % enhancement
compared to the grey-body thermal radiation for a broad peak centered at 720
nm. Furthermore, the hBN encapsulation layers permit stable and bright visible
thermal radiation with electronic temperatures up to 2,000 K under ambient
conditions, as well as efficient ultrafast electronic cooling via near-field
coupling to hybrid polaritonic modes. These high-speed graphene light emitters
provide a promising path for on-chip light sources for optical communications
and other optoelectronic applications.
