Title:
Scaling limit for Brownian motions with one-sided collisions
Abstract: We consider Brownian motions with one-sided collisions, meaning that each
particle is reflected at its right neighbour. For a finite number of particles
a Sch\"{u}tz-type formula is derived for the transition probability. We
investigate an infinite system with periodic initial configuration, that is,
particles are located at the integer lattice at time zero. The joint
distribution of the positions of a finite subset of particles is expressed as a
Fredholm determinant with a kernel defining a signed determinantal point
process. In the appropriate large time scaling limit, the fluctuations in the
particle positions are described by the Airy$_1$ process.
