Title:
Metropolitan quantum key distribution with silicon photonics
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) provide a compact and stable platform for
quantum photonics. Here we demonstrate a silicon photonics quantum key
distribution (QKD) transmitter in the first high-speed polarization-based QKD
field tests. The systems reach composable secret key rates of 950 kbps in a
local test (on a 103.6-m fiber with a total emulated loss of 9.2 dB) and 106
kbps in an intercity metropolitan test (on a 43-km fiber with 16.4 dB loss).
Our results represent the highest secret key generation rate for
polarization-based QKD experiments at a standard telecom wavelength and
demonstrate PICs as a promising, scalable resource for future formation of
metropolitan quantum-secure communications networks.
